| Keyword | Explanation |
|--------|:-------------------------------:|
| client | A client requests services and information from the server. Typically, a client is a computer application, such as a web browser. |
| dependencies | Dependencies are external code modules that are required to run your project. |
| endpoint | The part of the URL which comes after `/`. For example: `/chocolate` is the "chocolate" endpoint. |
| `express.static()` | The built-in Express middleware function that makes it possible to serve static assets. |
| `get()` | The Express method used to set up a handler function in Express. Takes two parameters: the endpoint, and the handler function. |
| handler function | A function that receives requests and tells the server how to respond to them. |
| method | Method is another name for a function. |
| middleware | A function (or functions) that are invoked by Express before your final request handler is executed. Middleware sits between a raw request and its final intended route. |
| module | A module is a bit of reusable code, written by you or someone else, that can be imported into a Node.js project using require. |
| npm | npm is a "package manager" for Node.js, meaning it allows you to easily install external modules (or chunks of code) published by others and use them in your project. |
| `npm install [package-name]` | The terminal command used to install a package from npm. |
| `package.json` | A `package.json` is the file used to store information about a Node.js project, such as its name and its dependencies. Read more [here](http://browsenpm.org/package.json). |
| port | A port is a number that serves as an endpoint, determining where you can access your web application. |
| request | A request is the message sent via HTTP from the client to the server, asking for information. |
| `require()` | Require is used in Node.js to import functionality from another file or an external module. |
| response | A response is the data sent back to the client from the server after an HTTP request is made. |
| routing | The definition of application endpoints and how they respond to client requests. |
| `--save` | When added to the end of an `npm install` command, `--save` adds that npm package to the `package.json` file. |
| `send()` | The Express method used to send information back to the client from the server. Updates the response object. |
| server | A web server is a software application which handles HTTP requests sent by the client, like web browsers, and returns web pages and information in response. |
| static assets | Files such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript documents or images that you want to appear in the browser. |
| `use()` | The method that tells Express to use a certain piece of middleware. |
